# Using Python to conduct a survey by Antwan Bolden
### May 8, 2020

For this project we are taking users' inputs to a survey and adding them to a dataframe. This type of survey can serve many real-world purposes such as aiding city or school officials assessing a districts' priority recipients for emergency resources and the method by which resources would reach these residents in the fastest manner. 

According to [usafacts.org](https://usafacts.org/articles/internet-access-students-at-home/), 4.4 million households with children donâ€™t have consistent access to computers for online learning during the pandemic. The following graph shows the percent of student in households with no internet or computer access by income.

An example usage of this survey could have been implemented in school boards' decisions to close their entire school system in response to COVID-19. Many school distrcits made this decision and presumed every household within the district had access to the necessary resources to replicate the classromm in a mobile environment. The information in the survey is for sample purposes only. None of the information represents any real persons.

# Explanation of the code

The following libraries were imported:

`import pandas as pd` - used import the vast toolkit that provides numerous tools for data analysis such as data structure and operations for manipulating numerical tables and times series. Pandas is abbreviated as pd as a matter of ease in typing.

`import os` - used to import the miscellaneous operating system interfaces from the os library

`import requests` - allows HTTP requests to be made.

`import json` - JSON is used to covert the python dictionary into a json string that can be written to a file

`import sys` - SYS is a library of system-specific parameters and functions.

# Validating user inputs
### Checking Yes/No inputs

After the intial question, which asks the user to input the user's name, each subsequent question is contolled by a while loop and within each while loop are if/else statements that contol the output (response to user). The first two (2) questions contain a while loop within the while loop that gives the user two (2) attemps to correctly answer the qualifying question. Should user fail to qualify on either question, the system will exit via `sys.exit` as shown below in Example 1. When a user's input is accepted, the While loop breaks and moves on to the next question.
```
EXAMPLE 1

Question 2

while True:
    USResident = input("Are you a resident of the United States?\n[Please enter Yes or No]: ")
    if USResident in ["Yes", "YES", "y", "Y", "yes"]:
        print("Great! You are a United States resident.")
        break
    elif USResident in ["No", "NO", "n", "N", "no"]:
        print("Sorry! This survey is only for United States residents.")
        while True:
            USResident = input("Are you a resident of the United States?\n[Please enter Yes or No]: ")
            if USResident in ["Yes", "YES", "y", "Y", "yes"]:
                print("Great! You are a United States Resident")
                break
            elif USResident in ["No", "NO", "n", "N", "no"]:
                sys.exit("Sorry! This survey is only for United States residents. Thanks for trying.")
            else:
                print("Sorry! Invalid entry! Please try again")
        break
    else:
        print("Sorry! Invalid entry! Please try again")
 ```

### Validating number inputs

There are 5 questions which require the users to input numbers. To ensure the users' input is a valid number (not a negative number or containing letters, symbols or decimals), we have utlized the function displayed in Example 2. This function is written at the top of code file and given the name 'inputNumber' and it applies to any questions that call that function. The function `inputNumber` checks that the user inputs an integer. Any acceptable answer is received and the code will break to continue to the next question. Any input that is not an integer returns the error message. The code in Question 4 also returns an error message if the user's input age is not within the inclusive range 18-50.
```
EXAMPLE 2

def inputNumber(message):
    while True:
        try:
            userInput = int(input(message))
            break
        except ValueError :
            print("Invalid entry! Please try again.")

    return userInput

Question 4

while True:
    age = inputNumber("Please enter your age: [Age must be a number between 18 and 50]\nPlease enter your age: ")
    if age >= 18 and age <= 50:
        print(f"Great! Your entered your age as {age}, which qualifies for this survey.")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid entry! Please try again.")
```
### Validating user's zipcode

The user is required to enter the zipcode of residence. Although the zipcode will be an integer, the `inputNumber` function is not called within this while loop. Instead, the while loop is written to check two things: 1) whether the zipcode is 5 digits in length and 2) if the zipcode is a valid United States zipcode. The zipcode length is checked with if len(zipcode) != 5, thus, if the zipcode length is not exactly 5 digits, the user will be prompted until a valid zipcode is entered. A valid zipcode is determined by calling an `api_url` and will only be valid upon returning a response code of `200` which is accessed by the import requests above. The user will be greeted with the city, state and zipcode based on the user's input that is stored using `datastore`. The variables `input_city` and `input_state` are generated from the `json.loads(response.content)` that the `requests.get` returns as shown in Example 3.
```
# Example 3

API_KEY = "JlfALuS6idZcTt2Cn5Z3FkUEosJSRkpfNnMV58w6PD3T971F0jUPuw087c0orm37"

while True:
  zipcode = input("What is your zip code?\nPlease enter your 5-digit zip code: ")
  if len(zipcode) != 5:
      print('Invalid entry! Please try again.')
      continue

  api_url = "https://www.zipcodeapi.com/rest/" + API_KEY + "/info.json/" + zipcode + "/degrees"

  response = requests.get(api_url)
  if response.status_code == 200:
    break
  print("Invalid entry! Please try again.")

datastore = json.loads(response.content)

input_city = datastore['city']
input_state = datastore['state']

print(f"Great! You live in {input_city}, {input_state} and your zipcode is {zipcode}.")
```
### Coding to output proper is/are response

When probing for number of chidren under 18 in the household, the code will accept any integer. However, the response to user will differ based on the number. If the user indicates the number of chidren is 1, the response to user will be 'You entered there `is` 1 child. A response of any integer other than 1 will return the response of 'You entered there `are` N children'. In example 4, the user inputs the number of children. The code checks the input to determine: 1) if the input is valid then proceeds to check the number to determine whether you respond using 'child or children' to correspond with 'is or are'.
```
# Example 4

while True:
    number_of_children_in_household = inputNumber("How many children under 18 years old reside in your household?\n[Please enter a number]: ")
    if number_of_children_in_household < 0:
        print('Invalid entry! Please try again.')
    else:
        if number_of_children_in_household == 1:
            child_or_children = 'child'
            is_or_are = 'is'
        else:
            child_or_children = 'children'
            is_or_are = 'are'
        print(f"You entered there {is_or_are} {number_of_children_in_household} {child_or_children} under 18 years old in your household.")
        break
```
### Skipping a non-applicable question

The follow-up question to number of children in the household asks whether the other parent resides in the household. Since some users will indicate 0 children in the household, it would be unnecessary to ask if the other parent resides in the household as that question would be non-applicable. Therefore, Example 5 shows how the code compares users' input to number of children in household. If number of children in household compares to 0, the other parent in household is marked as `NaN` in the CSV and the question is skipped. Otherwise, if number of children is 1 or greater, user is then probed for other parent in household. The code is written to where a '0' input to number of children in the household will skip any further questions relating to children in the household.
```
# Example 5 

while True:
    if number_of_children_in_household == 0:
        other_parent_in_household = "NaN"
        break
    other_parent_in_household = input(f"Does the other parent of your {child_or_children} reside in the household?\n[Enter yes or no]: ")
    if other_parent_in_household in ["Yes", "YES", "y", "Y", "yes"]:
        other_parent_in_household = 'y'
        print("You entered the other parent DOES live in the household")
        break
    elif other_parent_in_household in ["No", "NO", "n", "no"]:
        other_parent_in_household = 'n'
        print("You entered the other parent DOES NOT live in the household")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid entry! Please try again.")
        break
```
### Using a Tenary Operator

In checking to ensure the user's total household number meets the `minimum expected value` (user + number of children + other parent if applicable), the numbers cannot be added using the current inputs. The number of children is a number, other parent in household is answered using a string 'yes' or 'no' and there is no count for the user. Thus, a number and a string cannot be added. Therefore, a `tenary operator` (value_if_true if condition else value_if_false) is used to convert the string 'yes' or 'no' answer to a number. This `tenary operator` is utilized in calculating the `minimum expected value` for total household size as (number_of_children_in_household + (1 if other_parent_in_household == 'y' else 0) + 1) where (1 if other_parent_in_household == 'y' else 0) translates as if the user answers yes to other_parent_in_household, then add 1, otherwise add 0. The + 1 at the end of the equation represents the user. Supposing the user indicates 2 children in the household and the other parent does not reside in the household, the minimum acceptable household size is (2 + 0 + 1) = 3. If the user inputs a number less than 3, an error message is generated and the user will have to input at least the minimum expected number.
```
# Example 6

while True:
    number_of_children_in_household = inputNumber("How many children under 18 years old reside in your household?\n[Please enter a number]: ")
    if number_of_children_in_household < 0:
        print('Invalid entry! Please try again.')
    else:
        if number_of_children_in_household == 1:
            child_or_children = 'child'
            is_or_are = 'is'
        else:
            child_or_children = 'children'
            is_or_are = 'are'
        print(f"You entered there {is_or_are} {number_of_children_in_household} {child_or_children} under 18 years old in your household.")
        break

while True:
    if number_of_children_in_household == 0:
        other_parent_in_household = "NaN"
        break
    other_parent_in_household = input(f"Does the other parent of your {child_or_children} reside in the household?\n[Enter yes or no]: ")
    if other_parent_in_household in ["Yes", "YES", "y", "Y", "yes"]:
        other_parent_in_household = 'y'
        print("You entered the other parent DOES live in the household")
        break
    elif other_parent_in_household in ["No", "NO", "n", "no"]:
        other_parent_in_household = 'n'
        print("You entered the other parent DOES NOT live in the household")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid entry! Please try again.")
        break

while True:
    minimum_expected_total_household_size = (number_of_children_in_household + (1 if other_parent_in_household == 'y' else 0) + 1)
    total_household_size = inputNumber("Including yourself, how many total persons reside in your household?\n[Please enter a number]: ")
    if total_household_size < 0:
        print("Invalid entry! Please try again.")
    elif total_household_size == 0:
        print("Invalid entry! Total household size must be greater than or equal to 1.")
    elif total_household_size < minimum_expected_total_household_size:
        print(f"Invalid entry! You entered {total_household_size} which is less than your minimum total expected household size of {minimum_expected_total_household_size}.")
    else:
        print(f"Your entered your total_household_size is {total_household_size}.")
        break
```
## Writing to the CSV
### Naming the columns

The name of the `CSV` file is defined at the top of the code as `wowDataFinal = wowDataFinal.csv`. At the completion of the survey, the user's answers are then stored in variables as it appears in Example 7. The `s` represents a column in the CSV file that is created using `pd.Series`.
```
Example 7 

s = pd.Series(dtype=str)

s['first_name'] = name
s['gender'] = gender
s['age'] = age
s['race'] = race
s['city'] = input_city
s['state'] = input_state
s['zipcode'] = zipcode
s['number_of_children_in_household'] = number_of_children_in_household
s['other_parent_in_household'] = other_parent_in_household
s['total_household_size'] = total_household_size
s['high_school_or_higher'] = high_school_or_higher
s['employed'] = employed
s['personal_income'] = personal_income
s['homeowner'] = homeowner
s['transportation'] = transportation
s['home_internet_access'] = home_internet_access
s['incarceration'] = incarceration
s['child_incarceration'] = child_incarceration
s['victim_of_crime'] = victim_of_crime
s['child_victim_of_crime'] = child_victim_of_crime
s['stopped_and_frisked'] = stopped_and_frisked
```
### Try/Except block to create the CSV file

Example 8 shows a `try/except` block. Inside the `try` loop, the code looks in the code folder for a file named 'wowDataFinal'. If the file is found, the code appends to that file using `df = df.append`. If the 'wowDataFinal' file is not found, the `except` block is activated which will create a CSV file. The code will then take the stored data, create a CSV file named `wowDataFinal` and write to the file because the `mode='w'` instructs the code to write to stored data to the file.
```
# Example 8

try:
    df = pd.read_csv(wowDataFinal)
except:
    df = pd.DataFrame()

df = df.append(s, ignore_index=True)

df.to_csv(wowDataFinal, mode='w', index=False)
```
## Data Analysis
### Reading the data

Although there are numberous package managers and environment managers avaiable, [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) is a platform that offers package and environment management dependencies in one platform. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Once installation is complete, the command `jupyter notebook` can be run from the terminal to initialize and open Jupyter Notebook in the web browswer. Instructions on how to run and/or import Python into `Jupyter Notebook` are given [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#run-python-in-a-jupyter-notebook).

Once the `Jupyter Notebook` setup is completed and the `wow_final.py file is opened`, the data collected and stored in the `CSV` can be analyzed using the following process:

1. Typing `df = pd.read_csv('wowDataFinal.csv', index_col=0)` will make the `CSV` file accessible in the jupyter notebook.

2. Entering `df` in the next field will display the entire dataframe.

3. To view a portion of the code from the top, `df.head()` can be run. The default value will display the first 5 rows. To view a specific number, enter `df.head(N)` where N represents the number of desired rows to view.

4. Viewing portions of the code from the bottom follows the same pattern as viewing the code from the top. Entering `df.tail()` will return the last 5 items in the CSV.

5. To find the total number of rows and columns, enter `df.shape`. The returned values will display the rows, columns in that order where each row represents the user's inputs and each column corresponds to a question in the survey.

### Plotting data with Seaborn
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. (Instructions and technical details on how to use [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html))
```
Example of how to plot and inspect for any correlation to age, personal income and incarceration:

import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
sns.pairplot(data = df, vars = ['age', 'gender', 'personal_income', 'incarceration'])
```
![](images/screenshot.png)

### Using a Matplotlib heatmap to analyze the data
correlations = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlations, cmap ='Blues')
(Note: color changes to heat map can be made by changing the color value of `cmap`)

![](images/matplotlib_heatmap.png)

### Running a linear model
sns.lmplot(data = df, x = 'total_household_size', y = 'personal_income')
