# WOW-Py



For this project we are taking a users' inputs to a survey and adding them to a dataframe. The information can be distributed by city and school officials at the beginning of each year to create a database which can then be used to determine the residents and students who should be listed as priority recipients for emergency resources and the method by which
resources would reach these residents in the fastest manner.
